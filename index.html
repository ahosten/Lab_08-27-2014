    <h2>More Info on Prince</h2>
    <p2>Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age 
    seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, 17-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes 
    before releasing his debut album, For You, in 1978. His 1979 album, Prince, went platinum due to the success of the singles 
    "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?" and "I Wanna Be Your Lover". His next three records, Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981),
    and 1999 (1982) continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of 
    elements of funk, dance and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as the Revolution and released the 
    album Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name.
